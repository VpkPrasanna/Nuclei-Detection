Spot Nuclei .Speed Cures

The whole project is about to identify the Nuceli Detection from various images of Nucelus present data..

As it is based on computer vision domain , it is easy to detect the nucelus in the images.

To solve this problem i have used "U-Net" Architecture, it is one of the popular Architecture for image Segmentation .








                           U-Net Architecture




The Architecture explanis about u-Net


The Software stack that need to do this
1)Numpy
2)pandas
3)Keras
4)Skict Image
5)Matplotlib



The data set conatins images for test and train ,these datasets helps to train and test our model.

The Main Backend for this project is keras which run on top of tensorflow (Googles open source framework) for machine Learning 

WORK FLOW

1)Preprocess all the images to a format
2)Load the images
3)Create the model
4)Fit and train the model
5)Predict how well ourr model produce the results
6)Save the model checkpoint
